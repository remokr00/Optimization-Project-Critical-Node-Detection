# Critical Node Detection Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and related materials for the "Optimizing Critical Node Detection" project, conducted as part of the Simulação e Otimização course at the Universidade de Aveiro. This project explores the identification of critical nodes in a network using both metaheuristic and exact optimization methods, aiming to minimize the communication between surviving node pairs after node removals.

## Methods Used
- **Metaheuristic Algorithms:** Greedy Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) and Genetic Algorithm (GA)
- **Exact Optimization:** Integer Linear Programming (ILP) using `lp_solve`

## Dependencies
- MATLAB
- `lp_solve` software for ILP calculations, available [here](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/).
